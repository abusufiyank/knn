## Lung Cancer Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project focuses on predicting lung cancer using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset contains features such as age, smoking habits, area quality, alcohol consumption, and more. The goal is to classify whether a patient has lung cancer based on these features.
